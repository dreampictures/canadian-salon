I have already created a fresh salon website. 
Now I want ONLY the following updates. 
Do NOT redesign the website, layout, pages, routing, or backend logic. 
Keep everything else exactly the same.

1. LOGO UPDATE (IMPORTANT)
- Replace the text-based salon name shown in the header/navbar on all pages with a PNG logo image.
- The logo file will be uploaded in the project (for example: /public/logo.png).
- The logo must appear in:
  - Header / Navbar on all pages
  - Footer
- The logo should be responsive and properly aligned (same position where salon name text was earlier).
- Remove any hardcoded salon name text from header.

2. WEBSITE COLOR THEME
- Update the global website color theme to match the uploaded salon logo.
- Primary color: warm brown / copper tone similar to the logo
- Secondary color: soft cream / off-white background
- Accent color: darker brown for buttons, headings, and highlights
- Update:
  - Buttons
  - Links
  - Headings
  - Section highlights
- Do NOT change fonts or layout structure.

3. CERTIFICATE DESIGN (ONLINE DISPLAY ONLY)
- Certificates are NOT generated as PDFs.
- Certificates are NOT downloaded.
- Certificates are NOT printed.
- Certificate is only displayed ONLINE on the verification page.

4. CERTIFICATE LAYOUT (ONLINE VIEW)
- Certificate must be landscape orientation.
- Top center: salon PNG logo.
- Right side: student photo.
- Left side / center: certificate details (name, course, certificate number, issue date, etc.).
- Remove QR code completely (no QR anywhere).
- Verification page should only show:
  - Valid / Invalid status
  - Certificate details
  - Student photo
  - Salon logo

5. ADMIN / DATA LOGIC
- Keep existing database structure.
- Keep existing verification logic.
- No changes to API routes or backend unless required for layout rendering.

6. FILE STRUCTURE
- Use the existing React + TypeScript structure.
- Logo should be loaded from public assets.
- Styling should be done via existing CSS / Tailwind / styles (do not introduce new frameworks).

Only implement these updates and confirm once done.
