Task: Update the existing website (do NOT recreate from scratch).
The website is already working; only apply the changes below carefully.

1️⃣ Logo Replacement (Important)

The website name text (e.g. “LuxeSalon” or any text title in header/navbar) must be removed.

Replace it with a PNG logo image.


The logo must appear:

In the top navigation bar on all pages

In the certificate layout (top center)

2️⃣ Website Color Theme (Based on Logo)

Update the entire website color palette to match the uploaded salon logo.

Primary colors to derive from logo:

Warm brown / copper tones

Soft cream / off-white backgrounds

Apply colors consistently to:

Header & footer

Buttons (Verify Certificate, Get in Touch, etc.)

Headings & section highlights

Keep the website luxury, premium, salon-style (no bright or neon colors).

3️⃣ Certificate System – IMPORTANT CHANGE

Remove QR code generation from the online certificate.

Certificates will be designed manually in Photoshop, NOT generated visually by the website.

The website’s role is verification only.

Certificate rules:

Online certificate page should:

Display verification result only

Show student details fetched from database:

Student Name

Course Name

Certificate Number

Issue Date

Grade / Duration

Student Photo (right side)

NO QR code shown anywhere online

Verification page should clearly say:

✅ “Valid Certificate” OR ❌ “Invalid Certificate”

4️⃣ Certificate Layout (Online View)

Certificate verification result layout must be:

Landscape style

Salon PNG logo at the top

Student photo on the right side

Text details on the left

This is verification preview only, not a printable certificate.

5️⃣ What NOT to Change

Do NOT change:

Existing pages (Home, About, Services, Our Work, Contact)

Database structure unless required for verification

Routing and basic functionality

Do NOT add mobile app features — this is a website only.

6️⃣ Final Goal

A luxury salon website that:

Uses logo instead of text name

Matches logo colors

Shows certificate verification only

Looks professional, clean, and premium

Website must remain compatible for deployment on Fly.io.
