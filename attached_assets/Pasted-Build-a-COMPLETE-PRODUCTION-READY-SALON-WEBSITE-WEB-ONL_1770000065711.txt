Build a COMPLETE, PRODUCTION-READY SALON WEBSITE (WEB ONLY, NOT MOBILE APP).

IMPORTANT DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:
- This website MUST be deployable on Fly.io
- Backend MUST listen on 0.0.0.0 and use process.env.PORT
- Use Node.js + Express (NO experimental frameworks)
- Avoid complex ORMs unless absolutely required
- Use PostgreSQL with plain SQL or very simple queries
- All database tables must be created automatically on startup if missing

TECH STACK:
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Clean HTML/CSS/JS (or simple React if needed)
- No server-side rendering complexity
- No Replit-specific dependencies
